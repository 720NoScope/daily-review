            <h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
                <p>I was born on a special day, Feb. 29, 2000. This is a special
                day because it is a leap year day. It is even more special because
                it is a new millennium. I was born and raised in Fresno, C.A. with
                my 3 older sisters and my mom. I did not really know my dad until
                I was about 7 because my mom took us away from him when I was about
                2 or 3. My sisters names are Rebecca, Alyssa, and Davina. Rebecca
                is 17 now and Alyssa is 18. Davina is 23 and living in a house with
                her boyfriend. When I turned about 7 I finally was able to see my
                dad whose name is Travis.</p>
                <p>Some hobbies I have include playing videogames, hanging out
                with friends, and I also love to sleep. I also like to go camping
                and fishing too. A dream vacation I have is to go to Hawaii, but
                that is very expensive. I would love to go to Disney Land or 6 flags
                because I have never been to any of those places. </p>
            <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
                <h3>Long term goals</h3>
                    <p>I have many long term goals, but they are the typical goals
                    everyone have. First I want to go to college and graduate with
                    a degree to become a game designer. That takes me to my next
                    goal. I would like to work for a company that designs games.
                    Treyarc, Activision, and Sledge Hammer Games are just a few of
                    many companies that I would like to work for.</p>
                    <p>Another long term goal I want is to have a happy family.
                    I would like to have a boy named Travis, after my dad. I don’t
                    know what I would name my child right now if I did have a baby
                    girl. I only want one kid though, or twins. We will be one happy
                    family, hopefully </p>
                <h3>Short term goals</h3>
                    <p>My first short term goal is to graduate from high school 
                    with GOOD grades. I really do like Patino High and think it
                    will really help with my future outside of high school. I want
                    to learn how to code as well, and even advanced coding too. 
                    This will really help with my long term goal of being a Game
                    Designer.</p>
                    <p>Another goal I have is to get a driver’s permit or an M1 
                    permit. A M1 permit is a permit to ride motorcycles. I am currently
                    able to get one right now since in 15 ½, but I do not have the 
                    money to take classes. When I turn 16, I am going to try to 
                    get at least a driver’s permit.</p>
